                        <h3>MYCB</h3>
                        <p>My name is Chrislie Briel Mohomye Yotchouen, born on the xxth of November, xxxx, in Banka, Cameroon. 
                            I am the proud sibling of two brothers and two sisters. My formative years were spent in Bafang, 
                            where I cultivated a strong sense of community and family values, both of which have become integral to who I am today.
                            Naturally curious and always eager to explore new horizons, I have cultivated a passion for personal growth through 
                            diverse experiences. Whether spending time with friends, traveling, cooking, baking, or seeking out new adventures, 
                            I embrace every opportunity to learn and expand my understanding of the world.
                            Through my journey from Cameroon to Germany, from learning languages to embracing different cultures, I remain 
                            committed to personal growth, the pursuit of knowledge, and the connections that bind us all as a global community. 
                            I am excited for what the future holds as I continue to explore new opportunities and experiences.

                        <h3>Graduation</h3>
                        <p>Upon completing my General Certificate 
                            of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level, I relocated to Yaounde, Cameroon, the capital of our beautiful country, 
                            to further my academic pursuits. During this time, I also took German language courses at the prestigious 
                            Goethe-Institut, which not only enhanced my linguistic skills but also deepened my understanding of German 
                            culture. This period of growth proved invaluable in shaping my future aspirations. In March 2021, I embarked 
                            on a transformative journey by moving to Germany. This transition marked a significant chapter in my life, 
                            allowing me to broaden my perspectives and immerse myself in new experiences that have greatly contributed 
                            to my personal and intellectual development.

                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>Traveling is a profound passion of mine, and I take every opportunity to explore new countries and immerse 
                            myself in the diverse cultures that make up our world. Through these travels, I continually gain a richer 
                            understanding of humanity and an appreciation for the diversity that defines us.
                        </p>
                        <p>In my leisure time, I indulge in my passion for cooking and baking, two activities that allow me to express my creativity 
                            and bring joy to those around me. Additionally, I cherish moments spent with friends, watching movies, and listening 
                            to a diverse array of music genres.

            <p>As a dedicated Computer Science student, I have been building a solid foundation in key programming languages, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="color: black;">HTML und CSS</li>
                <li style="color: green;">JavaScript</li>
                <li style="color: black;">Java and C</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While I have gained a solid understanding of these areas, I am fully aware of the importance of continuous learning and growth. 
                I am eager to deepen my expertise in these technologies and explore new tools and methodologies in the ever-evolving field of 
                computer science. My goal is to apply my current knowledge while remaining open to new learning opportunities that will allow
                me to effectively contribute to a professional environment.</p><br>
